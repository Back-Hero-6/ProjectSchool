1. Project title: Project School (Unit 2)
This project aims to create a School Management System

2. Project Description
This application allows you to introduce and navigate through your school and add its specific content: its courses, its teachers and its students and all of their attributes. 
There is also a menu that allows you to navigate through the information provided: you have the possibility to:
- enroll students, 
- assign teachers, 
- show courses, 
- lookup courses, 
- show students, 
- lookup students, 
- show teachers, 
- lookup teachers, 
- and finally show the school√ïs profit.

3. How to use the project
You first have to introduce the name of the school you want to add into the system. Then, you can select the number of teachers, students and courses, and provide their details. When all the data is introduced into the system, there is a menu throughout which you can navigate, allowing you to access each of the system's functionalities.
Here is a more detailed description of how the application works:
o The application starts by asking the user for a name for the school
o Next, the user is asked for a number of how many teachers should be created
o Next, the user is prompted to enter the details of each teacher (such as name, salary,etc)
o Next, the user is asked for the number of courses to be created
o Next, the user is prompted to enter details of each course (such as name, price, money earned,etc)
o Next, the user is asked for the number of students to be created
o Next, the user is prompted to enter details of each student based on the number chosen above (such as name, address, email,etc)
o Next, the user is prompted to enter any command of the main menu to execute a specified action in the system.
In addition to the above, you'll be able to know the school's net profit at any time, also knowing the money earned for each course (even updating its value when a new student is enrolled).
